# Vehicle Inventory Manager (VIM)
This is probably one of the most anticipated tools by the 3den Enhanced community. While the default inventory attribute of Eden Editor is very clumsy to use, this GUI makes editing vehicle and ammobox inventories a breeze.

# Garrison
Fill buildings quickly with Eden editor entities. By default all entities are supported except markers.

### Black- / Whitelist
* Can be used to change from a blacklist to a whitelist and vise versa.

### Classes
* Classes of buildings which are either treated as whitelisted or blacklisted depending on the above setting. Classes need to be in the following format: class_1 class_2 class_n
Values can also be separated by ",".

### Coverage
* Coverage setting defined how many building positions are going to be filled. If *Nearest building only* mode is selected, this setting is ignored and by default all positions are filled if possible.

### Stance
* Stance the units use. Default is automatic stance. See ingame tooltips.

### Mode
* Closest Building only: Only the closest building to the center (ENH_Garrison_AreaHelper) will be garrisoned.
* From Center: Positions closer to the center will be filled first.
* Random Positions: A random position inside the area (ENH_Garrison_AreaHelper) will be picked for each entity.

### Path
* Disabled: Will disable the AI's path functionality.
* Enabled: Will enable the AI's path functionality. (default)

### Update Selection
* Can be used to change the selected entities. By default the entities which were selected when the GUI was opened are only affected.

### Cover Map Module
* The Cover Map module serves as a helper module. All buildings inside its area are affected. You can use the area scaling widget to change its rotation and size. Buildings which fit the criteria (Blacklist/Whitelist) are also drawn in 3D. If you preview the scenario while the GUI is still opened, this module will not get deleted. Just delete it manually when you return to the editor environment.

# Zeus Addons
This GUI allows you to quickly pick which addons will be available to Zeus. 

### CfgPatches
* Tick the entries you want Zeus to access/not to access. Whether or not the selected entries will be available or removed from Zeus depends on the module's setting. See _Module Setup_. 

### Content
* Upon selecting an entry on the left, this list will show all entities available in the currently selected patch.

### Copy
* Upcon pressing the _Copy_ button, a new window will open which shows all CfgPatches entries. Click _Copy_ again to copy the entries to your clipboard.

### Module Setup
The value you have copied to your clipboard alone won't do much. In order to define which addons are available to Zeus further steps are required.
* Place a _Game Master Module (ModuleCurator_F)_ 
* Set the _Variable Name_ of this module to _Module_Zeus_1_
* Place a _Manage Addons (ModuleCuratorAddAddons_F)_ module
* Set _Assigned Zeus_ to _Module_Zeus_1_
* Set the _Mode_ to _Remove_
* Paste the content of your clipboard into the _Addon classes_ input field
* Safe the settings

All addons you have previously selected will now be removed for this Zeus module. You can repeat the steps above for other Game Master modules.

### Notes
* If you want to add all the addons you have previously exported you have to set _Default addons_ in the _Game Master_ module to _None_ and change the _Mode_ in the _Manage Addons_ module to _Add_!
* Selection will be saved when the GUI is closed**
